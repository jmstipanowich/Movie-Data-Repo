# Microsoft in the Movie Industry


Author: James Stipanowich

## Introduction/Overview

Microsoft wants to create movies, but their movie knowledge is limited and they want knowledge about the movie industry from me. This project explores three questions Microsoft might be able to ask about movies and the movie industry from a specified given group of movie datasets. I will discuss three questions Microsoft may pose about movies and how these questions influence movie making. The researched analyses from the obtained data can provide conclusions on what movies to make and how to go about navigating the movie industry. Also, information on movies could help with future movie analyses and express how to continue to improve the movie making process.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired me to help them better understand the movie industry. I am charged with exploring three questions about what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

I was given the choice what data from this to use and how to use it.

These datasets were provided to me by Flatiron School for the Microsoft project.

### Movie Analysis Methods and Results


### Conclusions

- IFC Films, Universal Studios, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Brothers Studios created the most films in the Box Office Mojo dataset. They are popular studios to use or collaborate with for movie making.

- According to IMDb datasets, "Inception", "The Dark Knight Rises", "Interstellar", "Django Unchained", and "Avengers" are the movies that received the most number of online votes at IMDb.  They are great movies to look into for movie making based on their popularity.

- The "tn" movie dataset that was provided displays a fairly regular relationship between movie budget and domestic gross.  However, there were some higher budget movies in the dataset that might be considered outliers and did not necessarily produce higher domestic gross where as some lower budget movies in the dataset seemed to have the possibility of a slightly higher domestic gross.  The comparison is fairly normal, but there might be greater domestic gross for a movie with a lower production budget.
