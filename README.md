# Movie Data Analysis

## Introduction

In this lesson, we review the guidelines for the Phase 1 Project.

## Objectives/Business Goal



### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

It is up to you to decide what data from this to use and how to use it. If you want to make this more challenging, you can scrape websites or make API calls to get additional data. If you are feeling overwhelmed, we recommend you use only the following data files:

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

These datasets were provided to me as part of of a project for Flatiron School.
