# Microsoft in the Movie Industry


Author: James Stipanowich

## Introduction/Overview

Microsoft wants to create movies, but their movie knowledge is limited and they want knowledge about the movie industry from me. This project explores three questions Microsoft might be able to ask about movies and the movie industry from a specified given group of movie datasets. I will discuss three questions Microsoft may pose about movies and how these questions influence movie making. The researched analyses from the obtained data can provide conclusions on what movies to make and how to go about navigating the movie industry. Also, information on movies could help with future movie anaylses and express how to continue to improve the movie making process.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired me to help them better understand the movie industry. I am charged with exploring three questions about what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

I was given the choice what data from this to use and how to use it.

These datasets were provided to me by Flatiron School for the Microsoft project.
